My mate Will spent a lot of time on this and after an update and a crash he found that everything was gone. Unknowing how to fix it he started a new map.   
Upon hearing about this I gave it a go, found it, fixed it to work with the update, and he's too salty still to use it. Stubborn bastard.   
But after all the work he put into it I didn't want to see it go to waste.   
So, with his permission, I'm sharing his work with hope somebody finds it usefull.

### This is made with FS25 1.5.0.1 and AutoDrive 3.0.0.4. It should work with future update but it will probably not get updated.   

It works in singleplayer but this was made for multiplayer amongst friends so there are AutoDrive endpoints/locations for certain farms. Feel free to edit these out.
